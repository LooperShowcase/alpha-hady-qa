        2008-2012. The best years in our history Barça delight the world with
        their brand of football that is appreciated by football fans from all
        over the world. They win three more Champions League titles in a decade
        of dominance for the blaugranes From the season 2008/09 under Josep
        Guardiola, the team improved even further. Playing with the same style
        that Cruyff had introduced, Guardiola was a firm supporter of basing his
        team around the club's own youth system and promoted several young
        talents to the first team, and the result was the greatest Barça team
        ever. The greatest international recognition of this came when the FIFA
        Ballon d'Or nominations in 2010 shortlisted Xavi, Iniesta and Messi for
        the honour, all three of whom had grown up at La Masia, the residence
        where young sportspeople of all ages are trained and educated. This team
        was the culmination of everything that FC Barcelona stands for, and
        produced an amazing string of major titles, including two Champions
        Leagues and three Spanish Leagues, plus the long-awaited Clubs World
        Cup, which was finally won in 2009, that extraordinary year when
        Barcelona won all six major trophies, something unprecedented in the
        history of European football. Barça broke all kinds of records, played
        memorable matches and won just about every title on offer. But the
        finest hour for Guardiola's side came at Wembley on 28 May, 2011, when
        the world was enchanted by the kind of football that dreams are made of.
        The world's press bestowed praise on this extraordinary side that had
        written one of the most incredible chapters in the history of the game.
        The Guardiola era ended in 2012 but Barça continued their success under
        Tito Vilanova (the league in 2012/13) and Luis Enrique who in 2015 won
        the Champions League, the League and the Copa del Rey in another
        historic treble winning season. But it wasn't just the football team
        that was collecting honours. The basketball, handball, futsal and roller
        hockey teams also won further European titles. Furthermore, the season
        2011/12 and 2014/15 ended with a new record by winning 17 professional
        titles. Never before had FC Barcelona won so much silverware in a single
        season during its 118 year history. THE RETURN OF GUARDIOLA In 2008,
        Josep Guardiola accepted the difficult job of replacing Frank Rijkaard
        as coach and end a run of two seasons without a trophy. To do so, he
        applied the same style of play that was used when he was a player at the
        Club, an attacking philosophy based on passing and it turned out to be a
        great success. In his debut season, Guardiola won all three trophies
        available. After a winning start to the following campaign in 2009/10,
        Barça became the team of the Six Trophies, all won in the calendar year
        of 2009. The run of success continued with Guardiola claiming 14 titles
        of a possible 19 as coach in his four seasons in charge. Guardiola
        became a reference point in football and his Barça side went beyond the
        strictly footballing field. BARÇA WIN THEIR THIRD CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FC
        Barcelona went to the Olympic Stadium looking to claim their third title
        of the season after having won the Copa del Rey and the league.
        Guardiola went into the final against Manchester United with several
        players missing in defence. The Premier League side started strongly but
        Eto’o’s goal changed the game and from then on Barça dominated with
        Messi adding a second to make the final score 2-0. On 27 May 2009 Barça
        claimed their third Champions League title thanks to victory over the
        holders, becoming the first Spanish side to claim the treble of the Copa
        del Rey, the league and the Champions League. 2009, A MAGICAL YEAR Under
        the direction of Josep Guardiola, the team had a dream 12 months,
        winning every trophy possible. Six titles that they claimed with
        authority, Barça on the field were untouchable. At the end of the season
        there were celebrations and the trophies kept coming for the rest of the
        year. 13 May – Copa del Rey 16 May – League 27 May – Champions League 23
        August – Spanish Super Cup 28 August – European Super Cup 19 December –
        FIFA World Club Cup SANDRO ROSELL, NEW PRESIDENT Sandro Rosell rose to
        the presidency of FC Barcelona with an extensive background in both the
        business world and in football. His first stint in the management of the
        Club had begun in 2003 as a member of the board under then-president
        Joan Laporta. Rosell was the driving force behind the signing of
        Ronaldinho. Rosell’s candidacy used the slogan "We are all Barça" under
        an electoral program created after listening to the members for two
        years. In 2010 he was elected the new president of FC Barcelona with an
        overwhelmingly successful 35,021 of the votes, the best result ever
        achieved. Sandro Rosell thus became the most voted president in the
        history of the Club. BARÇA SWEEP THE PODIUM FOR THE BALLON D’OR FC
        Barcelona made history with the nomination of Xavi, Iniesta and Messi as
        finalists for the FIFA Ballon d'Or 2010. Three Barça players who all
        came up through La Masia swept the podium. Journalists, coaches and
        captains from around the world, the elite of world football, lauded
        Barça’s style. It was the first time that all three finalists came from
        the youth academy of the same club. It was a full recognition of the
        work done at La Masia. Three superstars developed at home, instilled
        with the values of effort, humility, sportsmanship and enthusiasm, were
        selected as the three best players in the world in 2010. WEMBLEY, AGAIN
        On 28 May 2011 Barça lifted its fourth European Cup. The victory came at
        the new Wembley Stadium, the same place where in 1992 Cruyff’s Barça had
        won the trophy for the first time. It was full of symbolism. After
        winning a very difficult semi-final against Real Madrid, Barça played
        for the title against Manchester United, who they had defeated in the
        Rome final two years before. A clearly superior Barça won 3-1 with goals
        each striker: Pedro, Messi and Villa. It was a great display of
        football, one of the best ever seen in a Champions League final. Europe
        hailed Barça, and the world press followed suit. At the end of the
        summer Barça confirmed its greatness by winning the Spanish Super Cup
        against Real Madrid and UEFA Super Cup against Porto.
